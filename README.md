# ConfigCat Config JSON schema

This repository contains the JSON schema of the ConfigCat Config JSON format.

## About ConfigCat

ConfigCat is a feature flag, feature toggle, and configuration management service. That lets you launch new features and change your software configuration remotely without actually (re)deploying code. ConfigCat even helps you do controlled roll-outs like canary releases and blue-green deployments. https://configcat.com

## Config JSON schema V6 (Config V2)

Config V2 is a new version of ConfigCat. It comes with a new Dashboard, Public Management API, SDKs, and features.

To support the new features in the SDKs, it was necessary to define a new, improved version of the config JSON schema, named V6. You can find the formal description of this new schema in the V6 folder. (It's worth noting that V6 is not backward compatible with the previous schema versions.)
